## Description

 In this project, you will select a dataset from a well-known source, conduct a comprehensive analysis, and apply various data mining techniques. You will analyze the data, describe its attributes, and implement methods such as decision trees, rule-based classification, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), naive Bayes, artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and ensemble methods. Finally, you will interpret and comment on the results of your analysis.

## Requirements

1. **Dataset Acquisition:** You will begin by choosing a dataset from recognized sources, such as the UCI Machine Learning Repository, Kaggle, or government open data portals. You should provide a brief overview of the dataset, including the number of instances and features.

  

2. **Data Analysis:** You will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure and describe the attributes, including data types, summary statistics, and potential issues like missing values or outliers.

  

3. **Data Preprocessing:** Next, you will need to clean the data as necessary, addressing missing values and normalizing or standardizing features. After preprocessing, you should split the dataset into training and testing sets.

  

4. **Implementation:** You are required to implement one of the data mining techniques from the following list: Decision Trees, Rule-Based Classification, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Ensemble Methods (e.g., Random Forest, Boosting).

### Questions that need to be answered
- What challenges did you face during data cleaning and preprocessing?

- How did you choose which models to implement?

- What were the key factors that influenced the performance of your models?

- How did you interpret the results of your chosen models?

- What insights can you draw from the data and your analysis?

## Chosen Data
1. **NFLVerse**
	- [Nflverse](https://github.com/nflverse) is a set of packages dedicated to data and analysis of the National Football League. From this we are using the 2023 Play by Play dataset.
 	- The dataset has approximatly 50,000 instances with over 250 attributes.	 

## Chosen methods
1. **Neural Network**
	- We chose a Neural Network for it adaptability when handling large datasets. Because NFL verse consist of nearly 50,000 instances with almost 300 attributes a model has to be able to handle a wide and varied dataset while still being robust and accurate.
2. **Decision Tree**
	- A decision tree was picked as our second method as it provides FINISH THIS
